//Beginning Cyber Security coursework at UNSW 

//18 Feb 2021
    
    //18 days before my first course ZZEN9201 starts.
    
    //I will be using 'DGNTDWI' for anonymity. I am studying Cyber Security at UNSW and the repository is my diary.

    //I trust this content may be of use to others. Please consider that your actions affect others for better or worse. Support each other with compassion and kindness.
    
    //I will endeavour to ensure transparency and imbue tidbits of my own thoughts into my repository as I trudge through the challenging coursework. My mistakes are your stepping stones.

//##Foundations of Cyber Security	ZZEN9201##

//Prestudy
    
    //I have given thought to documenting my experience in this coursework. I am commencing with no experience in the field, rather, a subtle aptitute for technology.
    
    //Today, I have installed Kali Linux through the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. Upon my first install error, I entered into the terminal, "sudo apt-get install dbus-x11" to continue with the installation.
    
    //Upon installing, I had to reboot and enter the BIOS to enable SVM mode for virtualisation with an AMD processor.
    
    //Once installed and running, I first queried my own IP address with "ip add' in the Kali terminal. Then opened Windows' Remote Desktop Connection, entered the IP address and the GUI appeared.
    
    //TIP: sudo service xrdp start ; ip add ; "OpenRDC"
