    //"I have given thought to documenting my experience in this coursework. I am commencing with no experience in the field, rather, a subtle aptitute for technology.
    
    //Today, I have installed Kali Linux through the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. Upon my first install error, I entered into the terminal, "sudo apt-get install dbus-x11" to continue with the installation.
    
    //Upon installing, I had to reboot and enter the BIOS to enable SVM mode for virtualisation with an AMD processor.
    
    //Once installed and running, I first queried my own IP address with "ip add' in the Kali terminal. Then opened Windows' Remote Desktop Connection, entered the IP address and    the GUI appeared."
